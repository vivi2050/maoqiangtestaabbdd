</div>

A not so well-named library for displaying desktop notifications.


```toml
[dependencies]
notify-rust = "4"
```

## Usage & Documentation
Please see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/notify-rust/) for current examples.


### Simple Notification
```rust
use notify_rust::Notification;
Notification::new()
    .summary("Firefox News")
    .body("This will almost look like a real firefox notification.")
    .icon("firefox")
    .show()?;
```

### Persistent Notification
```rust
use notify_rust::{Notification, Hint};
Notification::new()
    .summary("Category:email")
    .body("This has nothing to do with emails.\nIt should not go away until you acknowledge it.")
    .icon("thunderbird")
    .appname("thunderbird")
    .hint(Hint::Category("email".to_owned()))
    .hint(Hint::Resident(true)) // this is not supported by all implementations
    .timeout(0) // this however is
    .show()?;
```

## Linux/BSD support
The main audience of this library are Linux/BSD based desktop environments that follow the XDG specification (see [gnome dev docs](https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/) or [libnotify docs](https://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/index.html)). These include KDE, Gnome, XFCE, LXDC, Mate (and probably also most others that I haven't personally tested).

### Features

#### `images`
Enables sending of images with notifications. This is only supported on XDG. This will add the [**image** crate](https://lib.rs/image) as a dependency as well as [**lazy_static**](https://lib.rs/lazy_static) to determine the supported spec spec-version on startup.

#### `d`
Enables the usage of [**dbus**](https://lib.rs/dbus) instead of [**zbus-rs**](https://lib.rs/zbus) (also XDG only).
This is functionally identical to the default feature set.
**As long as you still compile with default-features this will only enable dbus usage, but not default to it!** In order to use the DBUS-rs implementation set the environment variable **`DBUSRS `** or compile notify-rust with **`--no-default-features`**.

### Requirements

|             | with dbus | with zbus|
| ----------- | ---       |   ---    |
| **`rustc`** | >= 1.51   |  >= 1.51 |
| **libdbus** | **yes**   |  nope!   |

## macOS support
This library shines on linux and bsd, which is its original target platform.
Lately it gained support for macOS thanks to [mac-notification-sys](https://crates.io/crates/mac-notification-sys).
However this only includes a small subset of the current functionality, since [`NSNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsnotification)s don't have as many features.

**call for participation:** You are a versed macOS UI developer with mad Objective-C skillz? <abbr title="pull request sil vous plait">PRSV</abbr>.

## Windows support
Similar to macOS we support windows via the help of [winrt-notification](https://crates.io/crates/winrt-notification).


## Commandline tool
Checkout [toastify](https://github.com/hoodie/toastify), it exposes most of the functionality of the lib to the commandline.
