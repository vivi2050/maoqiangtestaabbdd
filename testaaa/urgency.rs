/// Levels of Urgency.
///
/// # Specification
/// > Developers must use their own judgement when deciding the urgency of a notification. Typically, if the majority of programs are using the same level for a specific type of urgency, other applications should follow them.
/// >
/// > For low and normal urgencies, server implementations may display the notifications how they choose. They should, however, have a sane expiration timeout dependent on the urgency level.
/// >
/// > **Critical notifications should not automatically expire**, as they are things that the user will most likely want to know about. They should only be closed when the user dismisses them, for example, by clicking on the notification.
///
/// <cite> â€” see [Galago](http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/x320.html) or [Gnome](https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/#urgency-levels) specification.</cite>

///     .summary("oh no")
